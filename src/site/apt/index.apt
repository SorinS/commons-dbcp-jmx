commons-dbcp-jmx

  Wrapper around {{{http://commons.apache.org/dbcp}Apache Commons DBCP datasources}} to expose some metrics and operations as Mbeans.

  Others have {{{http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DBCP-292}already done this}}, but they rely on Spring. This one uses {{{http://github.com/martint/jmxutils}jmxutils}}.
